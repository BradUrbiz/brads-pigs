# Hello! Welcome to Brad's Pigs, the Minecraft mod that adds well, crazy pigs.

Have you ever wanted a different type of pig in Minecraft, aside from the normal one (yes the biome variants too)? Well, now you have it!

Find a Baboy (translates to pig in Tagalog language) in the stony peaks or jagged peaks biome. Once found, right click it until you eventually tame it.

# Features
STOCKING
- If you have tamed a Baboy, you can stock it up with TNT. Having up to a stack of TNT in your hand, right click the Baboy. The Baboy can hold up to 1 stack at a time.

TNT SHOT
- As long as the Baboy has > 0 TNT and a stack or less, you can fire a TNT shot. Click R while on the Baboy (can be configured in keybinds) to shoot TNT 12 blocks away. If the place you are trying to place is unavailable or obstructed by say a block, it will summon it at the next heighest valid place. (3 second cooldown)

MEGA FART
- Baboy tend to be gassy, so if you ever want to release a mega fart, just click V while on a tamed Baboy (can be configured in keybinds). This summons a lingering effect of poision that is sure to, well, be poisonous. (3 second cooldown)


# Requirements
This mod is designed for 1.20. Trying it on any other version may cause issues. Additionally to run this mod you need Fabric API and Fabric loader. And obviously Minecraft, idk how else you would be here to download this mod though.
This mod is client and server side but it is required on both ends.
